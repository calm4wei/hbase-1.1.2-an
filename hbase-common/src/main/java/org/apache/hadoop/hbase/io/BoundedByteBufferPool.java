/**
 * Like Hadoops' ByteBufferPool only you do not specify desired size when getting a ByteBuffer.
 * This pool keeps an upper bound on the count of ByteBuffers in the pool and on the maximum size
 * of ByteBuffer that it will retain (Hence the pool is 'bounded' as opposed to, say,
 * Hadoop's ElasticByteBuffferPool).
 * If a ByteBuffer is bigger than the configured threshold, we will just let the ByteBuffer go
 * rather than add it to the pool. If more ByteBuffers than the configured maximum instances,
 * we will not add the passed ByteBuffer to the pool; we will just drop it
 * (we will log a WARN in this case that we are at capacity).
 *
 * <p>The intended use case is a reservoir of bytebuffers that an RPC can reuse; buffers tend to
 * achieve a particular 'run' size over time give or take a few extremes. Set TRACE level on this
 * class for a couple of seconds to get reporting on how it is running when deployed.
 *
 * <p>This class is thread safe.
